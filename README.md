**"Most people are like a falling leaf that drifts and turns in the air, flutters, and falls to the ground. But a few others are like stars which travel one defined path: no wind reaches them; they have within themselves their guide and path."** 

The problem with which we are working?

After the global pandemic, every educational institution had shut down for a temporary time being which resulted in digital education. The problem here lies that before there was no exposure to online content but after those many new online contents have come up online either paid or free but they all are scattered and as a student, they don't know which online content is good or bad and by researching this they end up wasting their valuable time and the same problem happens when they search for new career options and they end up getting confused.

So this led us to build an app that solves this problem.
